# Multiplicative Persistence

- Takes a positive integer and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in the integer until you reach a single digit.
- Example:
  - Integer: 999
  > $$9 * 9 * 9 = 729$$ (1)
  > $$=> 7 * 2 * 9 = 126$$ (2)
  > $$=> 1 * 2 * 6 = 12$$ (3)
  > $$=> 1 * 2 = 2$$ (4)
  - Answer: 4
